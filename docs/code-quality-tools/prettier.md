# Prettier Configuration Explained üìù

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports many languages and integrates with most editors. It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. Prettier takes your code and reprints it from scratch by following the rules defined in its configuration file.

## Why Prettier? ü§î

- **Consistency**: Enforces a consistent code style across your project.
- **Saves time**: Automates formatting so you can focus on the code logic instead.
- **Integrates with ESLint**: Works alongside ESLint to ensure both style and quality.

- **`tabWidth: 2` & `printWidth: 100`**: Sets indentation to 2 spaces and lines to a maximum of 100 characters, balancing readability with modern coding practices. [tabWidth](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#tab-width), [printWidth](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#print-width)
- **`singleQuote: true` & `trailingComma: 'es5'`**: Uses single quotes for strings and includes trailing commas where valid in ES5, aiding in version control. [singleQuote](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#quotes), [trailingComma](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#trailing-commas)
- **`bracketSpacing: true`**: Applies space inside object literals, enhancing readability. [bracketSpacing](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#bracket-spacing)
